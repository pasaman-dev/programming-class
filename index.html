    <p>Here is a quote from wikipedia about computer:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komputer">
        Computer or PC is a tool used to process data 
        according to the procedures that have been formulated. 
        Computers are hardware devices that are closely related to technology. 
        Computers are able to help a variety of human work. The word computer was originally used to describe someone whose job it was to perform arithmetic calculations, with or without tools, but the meaning of this word was later transferred to the machine itself. Initially, information processing was almost exclusively concerned with arithmetic problems, but modern computers are used for many tasks unrelated to mathematics.
